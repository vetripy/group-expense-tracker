# group-expense-tracker
Traditional expense trackers focus on individual budgeting. But real-life spending often happens in shared environments — families, roommates, or groups of friends living together.

Tracking shared expenses can quickly become confusing without a structured system.

This app is built to make group expense management simple, transparent, and collaborative — allowing members to add expenses, categorize spending, manage roles, and view meaningful insights into their shared financial life.
